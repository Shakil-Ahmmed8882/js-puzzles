Problem:
Given an HTML document containing nested <div>, <ul>, <li>, <p>, <span>, <strong>, <i>, and <b> tags, you need to select specific elements based on the following criteria:

Select the parent <div>, <ul>, and <li> elements in one array.
Select the <strong> tags that are direct children of <i> tags, but not those that are children of <span> tags.
You are not allowed to use IDs or any other specific identifiers to select the elements. Instead, you need to navigate the parent-child relationships within the HTML structure.
